# Digital Art Gallery Technical Architecture

## Overview
The app uses a modern front-end stack with React and Tailwind CSS for a responsive, interactive UI. Firebase serves as the backend for data management, authentication, and hosting.

## Architecture Diagram
- **Frontend**: React components are structured within a component-based architecture, enhancing reusability and maintainability.
- **Backend**: Firebase handles data storage (Firestore), authentication, and static asset hosting.

## Component Structure
- **Layout Components**: Navigation, Footer, and Page Wrappers.
- **Gallery Components**: Masonry grids, lightboxes, and filtering functionalities.
- **Context**: `GalleryContext.js` manages the state across the app, including filtering, searching, and fetching data.

## Data Flow
- **Fetching**: Data is fetched from Firestore and rendered using context and state management.
- **Interactions**: User inputs are managed via controlled components, ensuring smooth updates across the UI.

## Future Considerations
- **Scalability**: Use pagination or infinite scroll to manage large datasets.
- **Security**: Implement Firebase rules to restrict access based on user roles.
